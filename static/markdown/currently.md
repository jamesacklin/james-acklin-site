## Currently

An attempt to keep track of what I'm working on, thinking about, designing, reading, or otherwise occupying my time with at a high level, without resorting to an entry-laden, prose-heavy "blog" format. Not strictly work-focused.

### April 2018
- Getting my head around [Choo](https://choo.io/), a lightweight application framework
- Researching publishing on the p2p web using the [Dat protocol](https://datproject.org/) and [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/)
- Reading _[A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language)_
- Thinking about people [harnessing](https://www.are.na/clint-soren/lot-2046) default supply-chain aesthetics for beauty

### March 2018
- Thinking about collaborative workflows for publishing user-facing documentation with Markdown and Github, using continuous integration and peer reviews
- Refactoring everything with [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/)
- Learning and implementing a new front-end for Rhiza using functional programming via [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame), [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Working on some design projects for an American cyclocross champion bike racer
