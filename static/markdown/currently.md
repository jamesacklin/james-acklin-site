# Currently

An attempt to keep track of what I'm working on, thinking about, designing, reading, or otherwise occupying my time with at a high level, without resorting to an entry-laden, prose-heavy "blog" format. Not strictly work-focused.

### January 2019

- Refactoring Rhiza's front-end using [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) in an adaptation of Google's [Material Design framework](https://material-ui.com/) with the help of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org), with the ultimate goal of publicly documenting our living design system to help other teams at Nielsen implement our best-in-class UI controls for data exploration and visualization
- Designing and developing [Send](https://github.com/jamesacklin/send), a progressive web app for reading, watching, and experiencing content from Dirt Rag Magazine online (designed with mobile/offline-first contexts in mind, then deployed using distributed and redundant web services)
