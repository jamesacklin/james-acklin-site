# 2018

An attempt to keep track of what I'm working on, thinking about, designing, reading, or otherwise occupying my time with at a high level, without resorting to an entry-laden, prose-heavy "blog" format. Not strictly work-focused.

---

## December 2018

- Reflecting upon and learning from a year of intense personal and professional development
