# Logo Work

Occasionally, I make logos for small businesses that can't afford to have a junior designer at A Large Branding Firm go through the same exercise at a 200% hourly markup. I typically deliver everything in multiple colors, a style guide, and everything they need to present well.

These people are mostly friends.
