I'm James Acklin, a product designer and front-end developer focused on usability, prototyping, and tooling.

I work full-time for <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#nielsen" id="nielsen-ref">Nielsen</a> in Pittsburgh, PA. I've created digital experiences and tools on the Web for startups, large agencies, and Fortune 500 companies for <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#clients" id="clients-ref">about a decade</a>. My design practice concentrates on human-centered design methodologies and high-fidelity prototyping with an emphasis on in-browser deliverables.

I'm currently interested in the following:

* p2p web projects using the Dat protocol
* Practical VR
* Voice interfaces
* Light, single-purpose web apps
* Screen-free computing

Occasionally I conduct branding exercises, help software companies and websites with interaction design problems, and do general graphic design work on the side. [Email me](mailto:jamesacklin@gmail.com) if you'd like to work on a project&nbsp;together.
