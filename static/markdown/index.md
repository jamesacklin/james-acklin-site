I am a multidisciplinary, collaborative visual and user experience designer (and occasional front-end developer) in Pittsburgh, PA.

I work on a team at [Nielsen](http://www.nielsen.com) that develops web-based SaaS market research software. I work with a user-focused team of front-end designers and customer success advocates to research, sketch, prototype, and usability-test all customer-facing features and system components. I coordinate with sales and product-owners to conduct high-level, human-centered design activities to discover user needs. I manage our design backlog and iterate with developers to construct scalable and flexible products in an aggressively agile&nbsp;environment.

I also occasionally do some work on the side; [email me](mailto:jamesacklin@gmail.com) if you'd like to work on a project&nbsp;together.
