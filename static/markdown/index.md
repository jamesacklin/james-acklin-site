I'm James Acklin, a product designer and front-end developer at Nielsen in Pittsburgh, PA. I have been working for about a decade creating digital experiences and tools on the Web for professionals and consumers. My design practice concentrates on human-centered design methodologies and high-fidelity prototyping with an emphasis on in-browser deliverables. At Nielsen, I research, prototype, design, and write some JavaScript for all user-facing features of a web-based data analysis and visualization tool called Rhiza, with a strong focus on geospatial analysis and repeatable workflows.

I'm currently interested in the following:

* p2p web projects using the Dat protocol
* Practical VR
* Voice interfaces
* Light, single-purpose web apps
* Screen-free computing

I occasionally do branding, graphic, and interactive design work on the side. [Email me](mailto:jamesacklin@gmail.com) if you'd like to work on a project&nbsp;together.
