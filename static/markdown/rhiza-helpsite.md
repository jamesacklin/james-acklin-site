# Rhiza Help Documentation

<span class="gray">Making Rhiza's help documentation process more collaborative</span>

---

## Problem Definition

The current Rhiza documentation site was authored and deployed by a single author as a stopgap solution during a time of rapid development in the company, which metastasized into a semi-permanent archive of all things Rhiza. Upon Nielsen's acquisition of Rhiza's, the site developed multiple audiences—Nielsen clients and internal folks both needed access to the same level of detailed documentation.

In order ensure Rhiza's documentation remained up-to-date for all users, I helped form a group of contributors who agreed to help our users by proactively documenting Rhiza's user interface as it changes. However, the single-authorship publishing model posed a significant hurdle to contributors.

The site was developed in an expensive Windows documentation software solution, and all of Rhiza's documentation was locked away in a proprietary format. Training a team of 5 to use this documentation software posed an expensive and time-consuming challenge—not only would it be costly to license the software itself, each contributor would need to run a Windows Virtual Machine on their computer.

Not only was the authorship model a challenge, preserving the existing order required each contributor to follow a detailed checklist of fairly technical steps with a large penalty for error. Furthermore, ultimately deploying the built site was beholden to an dev/ops engineer's schedule and interest.

Ultimately, this complex process was a non-starter for most of the team, blocking them from accomplishing their primary goal of writing and publishing Rhiza's documentation.

## Proposed Workflow

* Only teach people what they need to know to contribute
* Contributor model: everyone is responsible and can contribute
* Eliminate platform-specific tooling for authors
* Migrate content to open, plain-text document format
* Train authors on basic Github workflow, extensible to other career paths
* Keep entire project web-based
* Use free or low-cost tools
* Abstract or automate as much technical plumbing as possible
* Keeps the project "in-house": anyone can deploy
