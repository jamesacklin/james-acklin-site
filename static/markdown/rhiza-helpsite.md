<span class="gray">Making Rhiza's help documentation process more collaborative</span>

## Problem Definition
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

## Current Workflow
- Workflow is distracting people from doing what they need to do: write and publish documentation
- Single-author: all authorship lies with maintainer
- Content locked away in proprietary format
- Costly to install unique Windows VMs for everyone on the team
- Costly licensing agreement for documentation authoring software
- Training on documentation software time-consuming
- Requires author to retain deep knowledge of technical concepts
- Need to provision individual computers for SSH access to staging server
- Deploy process beholden to OPS schedule

## Proposed Workflow

- Only teach people what they need to know to contribute
- Contributor model: everyone is responsible and can contribute
- Eliminate platform-specific tooling for authors
- Migrate content to open, plain-text document format
- Train authors on basic Github workflow, extensible to other career paths
- Keep entire project web-based
- Use free or low-cost tools
- Abstract or automate as much technical plumbing as possible
- Keeps the project "in-house": anyone can deploy
