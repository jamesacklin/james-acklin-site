# Rhiza Help Documentation

<span class="gray">Making Rhiza's help documentation process more collaborative</span>

## Problem Definition

## Current Workflow

![](/images/helpsite-process-single.png)

- Workflow is distracting people from doing what they need to do: write and publish documentation
- Single-author: all authorship lies with maintainer
- Content locked away in proprietary format
- Costly to install unique Windows VMs for everyone on the team
- Costly licensing agreement for documentation authoring software
- Training on documentation software time-consuming
- Requires author to retain deep knowledge of technical concepts
- Need to provision individual computers for SSH access to staging server
- Deploy process beholden to OPS schedule

## Proposed Workflow

- Only teach people what they need to know to contribute
- Contributor model: everyone is responsible and can contribute
- Eliminate platform-specific tooling for authors
- Migrate content to open, plain-text document format
- Train authors on basic Github workflow, extensible to other career paths
- Keep entire project web-based
- Use free or low-cost tools
- Abstract or automate as much technical plumbing as possible
- Keeps the project "in-house": anyone can deploy
