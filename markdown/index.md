I work full-time for Nielsen^[At Nielsen, I research, prototype, design, and contribute production interface code for all user-facing features of Rhiza, a web-based data visualization tool (formerly a ~30-person startup spun out of MAYA Design, acquired in 2017) specializing in geospatial analysis and user-programmable workflows.] in Pittsburgh, PA. I've created digital experiences and tools on the Web for startups, large agencies, and Fortune 500 companies^[I have worked with consumer packaged goods brands (the family of Nestl√© ice cream brands, Del Monte foods, CLIF, Premier Protein), academic institutions and non-profits (The Winchester Thurston School, The Sarah Heinz House, The String Orchestra of Brooklyn), software vendors (VIA Oncology, Management Science Associates), retailers (Avalon Exchange, rue21, JOAN Boutique), restaurants (Primanti Brothers, Big Burrito), industrial and B2B concerns (HEICO Fasteners, HarbisonWalker International), and am beginning to branch out into the outdoor category (Aspire Racing/Jeremy Powers, the JAM Fund, and Dirt Rag Magazine).] for about a decade.

My design practice concentrates on human-centered design methodologies and high-fidelity prototyping with an emphasis on in-browser deliverables. I believe designers have an obligation to manipulate data and work with the raw material of the web.

Occasionally I conduct branding exercises, help software companies and websites with interaction design problems, and do general graphic design work on the side. [Email me](mailto:jamesacklin@gmail.com) if you'd like to work on a project&nbsp;together.
