Steady State Cycles is an outgrowth of Pittsburgh's premier professional road cycling shop, which had 17-year history of providing mechanical excellence, European racing bikes, quasi-rare components, and overall &ldquo;the best of the best.&rdquo; The new shop caters to performance-demanding bike racers and affluent enthusiasts. Steady State hosts road race viewing parties via Eurosport streams and have a culture of intense attention to detail, aerodynamic optimization, and sky's-the-limit builds.

The new, bootstrapped owners of Steady State commissioned me to provide a logo-mark, type, and essentially serve as their quarter-time in-house designer. We agreed on a few specific influences to check, such as Formula 1 racing, Porsche design, and Mavic's "special service course" line. In essence, we wanted to position Steady State Cycles as every cycling superlative.

### Outcome

Steady State Cycles is now a profitable and growing high-end cycling repair and sales operation in Fox Chapel, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The shop is a destination for riders and racers who appreciate a distinguishing touch for service and rock-solid guarantees. The owners have received multiple positive comments on the logo and identity system, and it remains one of the strongest graphic representations of cycling in the Pittsburgh area.
