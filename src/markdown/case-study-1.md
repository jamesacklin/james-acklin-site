Upon acquisition in 2017, Rhiza's general-purpose analytics product needed to serve the research needs of local TV & radio stations and networks. Nielsen wished to aggressively protect against revenue erosion to lower-priced competitors and turned to the newly-acquired Rhiza team for help. Our goal was to bring the simplicity of repeatable market research tools to local markets using the system we had built.

We proposed targeting two different groups of users, introducing "Creator" and "Consumer" roles. The objective was to mask off just enough complexity and provide a refined workflow for "Consumer" users, while enhancing expressive power and publishing capabilities for "Creator" users. Along the way, we would develop a syndication model of pre-built research stories for "Consumer" users to subscribe to—thus creating a new revenue stream for Nielsen in local markets.
